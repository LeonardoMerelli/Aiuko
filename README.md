## Aiuko
Aiuko is a web application designed to help users plan and monitor their weekly nutrition in a simple, smart, and personalized way.
The platform aims to make healthy eating easier by organizing meals throughout the week while considering personal goals, dietary preferences, allergies, and restrictions.
Aiuko combines a secure backend architecture with an intuitive and modern user interface. This technical foundation ensures reliability, scalability, and a seamless user experience across all devices.

## Framework
Built using Laravel, a open-source PHP-based framework which follows the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architecture and already provides all the essential components: an **authentication system**, **Eloquent ORM** to interact with the database through PHP objects, **security features** against SQL injection and CSRF attacks, a **routing service**, and more.
